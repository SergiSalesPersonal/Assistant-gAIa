# Predictive Model Project

This project aims to develop a predictive model using machine learning techniques. The model will be trained on a dataset, which will be processed and evaluated to ensure its effectiveness.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
  - **raw/**: Raw data files used for training the predictive model.
  - **processed/**: Cleaned and transformed data files for model training.
  
- **models/**: Stores trained model files and related artifacts.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
  - **exploratory_analysis.ipynb**: Used for exploratory data analysis, visualizing data distributions, and understanding relationships between features.

- **src/**: Source code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
  - **data_preprocessing.py**: Functions for loading, cleaning, and transforming raw data.
  - **model_training.py**: Logic for training the predictive model.
  - **model_evaluation.py**: Functions for evaluating model performance.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions used across modules.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists required Python packages for the project.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd predictive-model-project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place your raw data files in the `data/raw` directory.

4. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and transform the data:
   ```
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```

5. Train the model using the training script:
   ```
   python src/model_training.py
   ```

6. Evaluate the model performance:
   ```
   python src/model_evaluation.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

- Use the Jupyter notebook for exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand the dataset.
- Modify the source code in the `src/` directory to customize the data processing, model training, and evaluation steps as needed.
